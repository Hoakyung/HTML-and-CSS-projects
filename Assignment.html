		<h1> The Elephant </h1> 
	
		<p> My favourite animal is an elephant.
		Elephant is so big, yet have a nature of carmness<br >
		and I like the fact that the elephants are herbivore.<br>
		I like their long nose and how they use their nose like
		hands. I have linked youtube video clip to show how fun they are playing.</P>
